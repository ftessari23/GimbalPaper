# Gimbal Device

This repository contains the design files and assembly details for the **Gimbal apparatus** used in our recent publication. The device was developed to study human wrist rotations in both **kinematics** and **dynamics** experiments.  

## 📂 Repository Contents
- **`BoM.xlsx`**  
  Bill of Materials (BoM) listing the off-the-shelf components used. These are the exact parts I sourced (U.S.-based suppliers), but they are **not the only options**—equivalent components may be substituted.  

- **`.sldprt` files**  
  Individual **SolidWorks part files** for each component.  

- **`.sldasm` file**  
  Complete **SolidWorks assembly file** for the gimbal system.  

- **`.stl` files**  
  Components for **3D printing**. I printed them on a **Bambu FDM printer** with PLA filament.  
  - Recommended infill: **60–75%** for structural strength.  
  - Settings may be tuned depending on intended use.  

## ⚠️ Notes & Limitations
- The current design is **functional but not perfect**.  
- The **handle–fork connection** is the weakest point and has been the main failure site in testing.  
- The apparatus performs **reliably in pushing tasks** (as demonstrated in the paper).  
- It is **not recommended for pulling tasks**, as the handle–fork connection is likely to fail under tensile loads.  

## 🔧 Future Improvements
- Reinforcement or redesign of the **handle–fork interface**.  
- Optimization of the printed components for higher fatigue resistance.  

## 🌍 Applications
This gimbal system may be useful for researchers interested in:  
- Studying **human wrist rotations**.  
- Designing experiments involving **joint kinematics** or **interaction dynamics**.  
- Exploring applications in **rehabilitation robotics** and **biomechanics**.  

## 🤝 Contributions
Feel free to **edit, improve, or update** any part of the design. Contributions and forks are welcome to refine the apparatus for broader use.
